      <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Anthony Namroud, and this is my profile. My interests in Information technology (IT) started from a very young age, I used to play video games, use mobile phones such as the Nokia 3220, watch animations, build my own computers, and even use Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel, Word, and Access.
	As I grew up my interest evolved into basic forms of programming, such as formulas on excel, Macros (Automation), Hypertext Markup Language (html) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). I wish to pursue my career within the Information Technology department.</p>

        <p>My favourite hobbies include camping, fishing, hiking, playing video games, spending time with family/ friends, and creating music through sound engineering applications like FL Studio. What motivates me to progress through my career is my passion, commitment and willingness to go beyond my comfort zone to learn and advance in as many fields around network engineering and cyber security engineering.</p>
